# monGPT

You know this project is old because it was based on minGPT instead of NanoGPT. 

The purpose of this is to train a transformer to autoregressively predict Pokemon teams 
(in hindsight, maybe a BERT-style model w/ masked team members would have been the better choice, but this was an experiment).

Usage and other stuff are TBD, I'm probably not doing more with this, but I'll upload it and document it later in case
anyone finds it interesting.

Also, I used a (very bad) selenium based replay scraper when I should have just used the Pokemon Showdown API (which I didn't know about at the time)
so the dataset download stuff will come later.
